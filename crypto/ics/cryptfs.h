/* This structure starts 16,384 bytes before the end of a hardware
 * partition that is encrypted.
 * Immediately following this structure is the encrypted key.
 * The keysize field tells how long the key is, in bytes.
 * Then there is 32 bytes of padding,
 * Finally there is the salt used with the user password.
 * The salt is fixed at 16 bytes long.
 * Obviously, the filesystem does not include the last 16 kbytes
 * of the partition.
